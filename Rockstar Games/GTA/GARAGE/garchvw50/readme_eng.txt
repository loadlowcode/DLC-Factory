Game Archive Viewer v5.0
_____________________________

Game Archive Viewer is an utility for editing pseudoarchives of some games. Now, four formats are supported:
* IMG of GTA: Vice City
* IMG of GTA: San Andreas
* SYB of Syberia 2
* BIG of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
* PK4 of Prey
* BIN of Chaps and the Ring
* PAK of Dungeon Cleaners
(archives of two last games accessible only for reading)

Attention! I'm not guarantee that this program will work correctly in all cases and I will not be responsible for its errors. So I ASK you to send me letters with information about such errors, but I'll consider any reproaches ungrounded. Maximal damage, applied by my program to your computer is impossibility to run proper game, so always backup files before editing.

If you'll find some errors in eglish translation or in this readme, you can send letter about it to denull@narod.ru. If you want to help with translation of this file, you can contact me too.
